If you tell me that I can't<br>
I will, I will, I'll try...<br>
If I say that I will do it<br>
I'll do it when I want...<br>
I control... I control my world<br>
I live beyond the dreams<br>
Don't overwhelm me<br>
Why you cut my wings?<br>
This soul you think you own<br>
Wants to break the walls<br>
You try to control my mind<br>
Why do you do it?<br>
I don't want to be like you<br>
'Cause I'm feeling free<br>
In my world I live without walls<br>
Deciding who I am<br>
Looking for my place<br>
Freedom in my hands<br>
Don't wanna fight no more<br>
You should know that...<br>
I live my own life<br>
Don't try to stop me!<br>
Don't make me waist time<br>
'Cause I am my own guide<br>
I don't do the right things<br>
But it doesn't matter<br>
I don't want to be like you
I live my own life<br>
Understand... Try to understand<br>
That I am who I am<br>
You know me so well<br>
I'm not gonna change<br>
I've never been your doll<br>
You should know that...<br>
